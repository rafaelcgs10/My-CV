Hi, I'm Rafael.

\medskip

I'm a working computer scientist and a developer.
I'll talk a bit about myself and what I'm interested about.

\medskip
I'm a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, and my research is about the formal verification of stream processing systems.

Since my Bachelor studies, I have learned about technologies that improve the trustworthiness of software.
My journey started with Automata Theory, went through robust static type systems, and moved towards proof assistants.
More specifically, I learned about the Curry-Howard correspondence, and I found about proof assistants like Coq and Isabelle, and languages with dependend types like Agda and Idris, I was very surprised to see what people were doing with it.
For example, I found out CompCert, a C compiler with a fully verified backend.
In my masters I have used Coq to verify a type inference algorithm, and now I use Isabelle/HOL in my PhD research.

\medskip

After I finished my masters I ended up working in the software industry as most do.
I was lucky enough to find a very interesting project to be part of, being brief: it was a stream processing system that had to maintain the eventual consistency of materialized view.

\medskip

Best regards, Rafael.
